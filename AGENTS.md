# Project Instructions

Follow the shared Codex preferences documented in the `codex-preferences` repository.

If a local machine-specific copy exists, it may live at:
`/Users/wendy/.config/codex/PREFERENCES.md`

If this project is resumed mid-development, create or read `WIP_NOTES.md` before making changes.

If there is any conflict, ambiguity, or risky external action, ask before executing.
